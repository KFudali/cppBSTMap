Simple cpp project to compare Binary-Search map, Red-Black-Tree map and a std::map. Served me as a test ground for implementing data structures. 

All code is based on the wikipedia articles, cpp-reference map page:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red%E2%80%93black_tree
https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/map
Written mainly by me with some ai help for debugging.
