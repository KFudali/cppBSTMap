Simple cpp project to compare Binary-Search map, Red-Black-Tree map and a std::map. I added the naive vector map as a reference. Served me as a study resource for implementing data structures. 

All code is based on the wikipedia articles, cpp-reference map page:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red%E2%80%93black_tree
https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/map
Written mainly by me with some ai help for debugging.

For iterators i used information provided here:

and given in great talk "Back to Basics: Designing Classes (part 2 of 2)" by Klaus Iglberger at CppCon 2021
